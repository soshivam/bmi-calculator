#My BMI calculator is an interactive web app that helps users
calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI). Using JavaScript, it takes
weight and height inputs through sliders that update in real-time.
The project uses formulas and conditional logic for feedback based
on BMI ratings, showcasing my programming skills and adding value to
my portfolio.
